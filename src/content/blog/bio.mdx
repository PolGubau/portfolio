## Origins

I started my career as graphic designer aimed by my <strong>Arts Bachelor</strong> degree where I worked for a few assignments during my high
school even some for the school itself. I also won a few design hackathons:

  These are a few examples of design hackathons submitions that I won during
  2019 and 2020.

As a graphic designer, I was always interested in the digital world and websites in particular. I started to learn
**HTML** and **CSS** by myself, and then I decided to study a technical degree in **Interactive Communication**, in UAB (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona).

## Interactive Communication

During my degree, I learned a lot about **web development**, **design**, **communication**... I also learned about **video editing** and **photography** with some opportunities to work in a few projects for real clients.

The first year of the degree I faced some technologies that I already knew as Python or PHP, I remember that I was the only one in the class that knew how to code in Python so I helped a bit the rest of the class, reaching the point that the teacher used my notes to correct the homework🤓 (it's searchable online).

I also learne about **Photography** and **Communication Law**, subjects that the first day I thought I would hate but I ended up loving and still using them in my day-to-day.

### First steps in the labor market

The Photography teacher encouraged us to search real projects using the class
knowledge, so with <At href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-martinez-alcocer/" label="Gerard" /> and <At href="https://www.instagram.com/victorciezar" label="Victor" />
we started checking google maps to find
companies that could need a photographer and we started to call them. We ended
up working for a few car dealerships as photographers and video editors.

Thinking about expanding the small business that we had, I decided to create a website for having an online presence so I did a simple but fancy **landing page** with our portfolio, a contact form and a **blog** where we could post our latest projects. Some people started contacting but not for the photography services, they wanted a website like the one that I did for us.

## Freelance web developer

I was the only one in the friends group that knew how to code so I started to submit proposals to the clients that contacted us. The average project was an easy wordpress landing and ecomerce website, so I learned **Wordpress** and **Woocommerce** to be able to do them. I also learned **SEO** and **Google Ads** to be able to offer a complete service to the clients.

 
### Wordpress developer

The second year of the degree we did some PHP courses, I had some advantage because I already knew the language so I focused in checking a step further as **MVC** and **OOP**. I also learned **MySQL** and how to use them with PHP. And finally, I faced **Laravel** but was definitely too much for me at that moment.

### SEO and Google Ads

A bit frustrated because I couldn't do the projects that I wanted with PHP, I started to learn **Javascript** and **Jquery** by myself and I started to do some projects with them. I also learned **Bootstrap** and **SASS** to be able to do better websites.

### Javascript developer

Using PHP, HTML, SASS ans Jquery (a bit outdated but still the standard that year) I completed a fancy portfolio, class projects and small client projects.

## Graphic designer

Once in my German language class, I met a guy that was working in a startup that needed a graphic designer, so I started to work for them. During the following 2 years, I worked there creating social media posts and general branding inside of the communication department. I also mastered **Illustrator** and **Photoshop** to be able to do better designs but after some tests we decided to use **Figma** as the main design tool.

<div className="flex w-full mb-16">
  <BlogLink slug="/projects/nuwe" name="Check what I did in Nuwe" />
</div>
As they were a small team, I had some free time while submitions, so I also focused
in development to be able to be hired as a Software developer soon.

## Fullstack developer

The third year of the degree we started modern frontend as **Javascript** and **Databases**, but the courses done in class were too basic for me so I started to learn **React** and **Node** by myself. I also learned **PostgreSQL** and **Typescript** to be able to do fullstack projects.

React and Typescript were a game changer for me, I started to do more complex projects and I started to learn **NextJS** and **Gatsby** to be able to do **SSR** and **Static** websites. I also learned **Tailwind** and **Styled Components** to be able to do better websites.

Using some personal project and small client projects I completed a fancy portfolio (previous to this one you are navigating on). Also, I worked as a fullstack developer inside of the university for a few months.
There, I learned **AWS** and **WebTV** to be able to do a complete project where we had to do a **Netflix** like platform for the internal university projects.

# Mesalvo

During those months, I found myself using my free time to create small frontend side projects, that reveled me that I was more interested in Frontend than just design.

While I was creating content for Nuwe, I decided to search a job as a Frontend Sofware Developer and I found one at **Mesalvo**, was a huge step for me because it was a full time job and I was still studying. In the last moment, I decided to accept the offer and I started to work there.

## Full time Frontend developer

That huge step resulted in one of my best decision ever, I met incredible people and I mastered my skills as a Frontend developer. We created international products using **React**, **Typescript**, **Redux**, **Tailinwd**...

My division was a small team inside of the Innovation HUB of the company, so we had a lot of freedom to create new projects and to decide the technologies that we wanted to use. With <At label='Francesco' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-fabrissin/'/> and <At label='Emiliano' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliano-de-santis-64619040/'/> we created an incredible ecosystem and it resulted in a high quality product.

## Erasmus in Sweden

The second semester of the third year I did an Erasmus to **Kalmar, Sweden** where I focused my skills also in **International Business** and **Marketing**. I also learned a bit **Swedish** to be able to communicate with the locals.

## Back to Spain

Once back in Spain, I focused even more in Mesalvo and I started playing with **React Native** to be able to do mobile apps. Also I did some projects using **Astro** and **Svelte** to be able to do **Static** websites and to discover these 'posible new Reacts'.

## Studing in Salamanca

The first semester of the last year I did an Erasmus to **Salamanca, Spain** where I focused my skills also in Media and Advertising.

More a theoretical semester than a practical one, I had the oportunity to learn from high level teachers and to meet incredible people.

Using my **Big Data and Knowledge Society** I continued my **Python skills** to practice with **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.

I also took part in a **European Union** project to support some European activities and social projects.

For some submittions I had written some **articles** and **essays** about **Spanish Media** and **Advertising**.

## Last university year, thesis

The last months in UAB were focused in the development of my thesis, a **UI library** for **React**, I struggled a bit about what name to give to the library, but at the end it was a UI library made by me so I decided to call it **Pol/UI**. 

I spent +1000 hours creating the project, the documentations, the written thesis and the presentation.

<BlogLink slug="/projects/polui" name="Check the Pol/UI Thesis" />

Pol-ui ended up being a complete library with +100 components, a complete documentation and multiple examples of how to use it.

It got a perfect score of 10/10 and it was awarded with a special mention by the university.

## Germany

Once I finished the degree, I decided to move to Germany where the company that I was working for, Mesalvo, had the headquarters. I continued working there as a full time Frontend developer and I also started to learn **German** to be able to communicate with the locals.

I started opening to new technologies as **Java**, not to take more story points but to be able to understand the backend part of the projects that I was working on.
